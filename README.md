# A Better Public Transportation System
# This project aims to optimize the Vancouver public transportation system by providing real-time scheduling data, operational vehicles and routes information, user feedback and environmental impact tracking through an Oracle database. It will manage bus and train schedules, vehicle maintenance, and ridership data to improve efficiency and wait times for customers, at the same time meet the cityâ€™s sustainability goals.
